# General Info
This repo intends to create an easy, user accesible and open-source tool for running a series of third party predictions software. The main focus is on:
* Dockerfiles for easy installing existing prediction software.
* a Python API for facilitating parsing and organising each predictor's output data.
* a common workflow language (CWL) pipeline that facilitates large protein sequences sets prediction jobs submissions.
